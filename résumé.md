### Software Engineer, Stripe

July 2017 - Present

I started on Connect, building Express and working on the Accounts API.
In 2018, I moved to the new Connect Account Experience team and helped
to start the Chicago office. There, I shipped Connect Onboarding for
Custom and Standard, built productivity tools, and helped grow Stripe's
hosted Connect offerings by five orders of magnitude. In 2021, I moved
to be an engineer under the Express Engineering banner, focusing on
security, forward-looking infrastructure, and driving cross-org efforts.


### Founder, Pinecast

2016 - Present

I started [Pinecast](https://pinecast.com) as a simple way to start and
manage a podcast. Pinecast is [open source](https://github.com/Pinecast)
and boasts an impressive feature set targeting amateur and semi-
professional podcasters.


### Software Engineer II, Uber

January 2016 - May 2017

I led front-end development on Uber's Crystal Ball team, where we built
software for performing financial forecasting and making predictions. I
currently work on the Finance Engineering team, leading front-end work
for financial forecasting, planning, and data management.

I also build developer productivity tools and Node libraries for IBM's
Cognos TM1 software and surrounding technologies.


### Senior Software Engineer, Box

January 2014 - January 2016

At Box I help the Performance Team improve the speed of the Box web
application. In this role, I've helped to lead the effort to redesign and
rewrite the front-end of the Box web application while also helping to
refactor and improve the underlying back-end PHP code. I also have worked
to help engage teams outside of the Engineering org in an effort to
increase awareness of performance and software best practices.

I have built and deployed two of Box's open source projects. My work on
Shalam--a novel CSS spriting tool--resulted in the filing of one of five
patents that I developed at Box. Brainy--a security and performance-
centric fork of the Smarty templating language--has been included in
[PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/#compiled_templates).

Relevant Experience: PHP, JavaScript, Python

contractor, I ported these tools for use with the Marketplace and HTML5 apps.
